codecademy responsive club project

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate: ​

*Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.

*Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.

*Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
